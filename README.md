# Ruby Brewer
### A Ruby API for adaptiman/adaptibrew

# Disclaimer
This is just an API to make adaptibrew more user friendly. It will provide a clean shell and easy to understand methods for all the actions you need to control your brew rig. This will require an actual brew rig and all the equipment listed in [adaptiman/adaptibrew](https://github.com/adaptiman/adaptibrew). If you are looking to build an automated brew rig, **this is not the place to start**. Head over to [adaptiman/adaptibrew](https://github.com/adaptiman/adaptibrew), or hit up [adaptiman](https://github.com/adaptiman).

# Installation
This package is a weird half-breed Frankenstein's monster type of thing. You can install it as a gem with
```shell
gem install brewer
```
and `require 'brewer'` in your ruby code, or run
```shell
brewer
```
to open an interactive shell to control your brew rig in realtime. Fancy.

# Documentation
**Warning: RDoc may have a seizure when encountering Gemfiles, Rakefiles, etc. Basically files that don't end in `.rb` but have ruby syntax. Docs will be a bit weird on those files. I suggest just reading the comments in source.**
Documentation is in `doc/` or on rubygems.org
